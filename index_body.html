            <h3>The Story of How We Met</h3>
            <p>
                Thursday, September 1<sup>st</sup> 2011: a blackout hit UMBC after Hurricane Irene arrived on the East Coast. Liz and Dustin were both in their respective dorms when the lights went out. Liz popped her head out into the hall and met a girl named Tara who invited her to go a Welcome Week event, but first they had to swing by the courtyard of another dorm to pick up her friend. Liz, as a new sophomore transfer student at UMBC was eager to make new friends and tagged along. Dustin headed down to that same courtyard to meet up with a friend of his where there was a s&rsquo;mores social going on. Dustin, who happened to be in an acquaintance of Tara&rsquo;s, came over to say hi, and Dustin and Liz hit it off immediately. Liz decided not to continue on with Tara and her friend so that she could stick around and spend more time with Dustin. Dustin, who had made plans with a friend to also go to the other event, made him come back to the courtyard so he could spend more time Liz. The three of them became fast friends and immediately set off on an adventure exploring campus and going on secret missions. Dustin and Liz became inseparable from then on. To commemorate the night they met, they made a habit of particularly celebrating Thursday nights which Dustin named Thoroughly Sleep Deprived Thursdays. As neither of them had Friday classes, they would stay up late making things, reading plays, and even talking on a bench one night until the sun came up. Liz and Dustin have been blissfully happy and in love ever since and are looking forward to spending the rest of their lives together.
